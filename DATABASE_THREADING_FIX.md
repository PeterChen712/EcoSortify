# 🔧 Database Threading Issue - FIXED

## 🚨 **Problem Description**
When users tried to purchase a skin by clicking the "Buy" button, the app crashed with a fatal exception:

```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot access database on the main thread since it may potentially lock the UI for a long period of time.
```

**Root Cause:** The `updatePoints()` database operation was being executed on the main UI thread, which is prohibited by Room Database to prevent UI blocking.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Before (Problematic Code):**
```java
@Override
public void onSkinPurchase(ProfileSkin skin) {
    if (currentUser.getPoints() >= skin.getPrice()) {
        int newPoints = currentUser.getPoints() - skin.getPrice();
        
        // ❌ DATABASE CALL ON MAIN THREAD - CAUSES CRASH
        db.userDao().updatePoints(currentUser.getId(), newPoints);
        
        // UI updates...
    }
}
```

### **After (Fixed Code):**
```java
@Override
public void onSkinPurchase(ProfileSkin skin) {
    if (currentUser.getPoints() >= skin.getPrice()) {
        int newPoints = currentUser.getPoints() - skin.getPrice();
        
        // ✅ MOVE DATABASE CALL TO BACKGROUND THREAD
        new Thread(() -> {
            db.userDao().updatePoints(currentUser.getId(), newPoints);
            
            // ✅ MOVE UI UPDATES BACK TO MAIN THREAD
            requireActivity().runOnUiThread(() -> {
                currentUser.setPoints(newPoints);
                // Update preferences and UI...
                updateUserPointsDisplay();
                adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
                Toast.makeText(requireContext(), 
                    "Successfully purchased " + skin.getName() + "!", 
                    Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            });
        }).start();
    }
}
```

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### **1. Threading Strategy**
- **Background Thread**: Database operations (`updatePoints()`)
- **Main Thread**: UI updates (`Toast`, `adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()`, etc.)

### **2. Proper Thread Management**
- Used `new Thread()` to execute database operations off the main thread
- Used `requireActivity().runOnUiThread()` to safely update UI components
- Ensured all database-related operations are non-blocking

### **3. Maintained Data Consistency**
- Local user object updated immediately after successful database operation
- SharedPreferences updated for owned skins persistence
- UI refreshed to reflect changes

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix**

### **Test Case 1: Successful Skin Purchase**
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have enough plogging points (check Profile page)
2. **Action**: 
   - Navigate: Profile → Settings → Customize Profile → Pilih Skin/Latar Profil tab
   - Find a locked skin with purchase button
   - Click "Buy" button
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ No crash occurs
   - ✅ Success toast appears: "Successfully purchased [Skin Name]!"
   - ✅ Points are deducted from your total
   - ✅ Skin becomes unlocked and selectable
   - ✅ UI updates immediately

### **Test Case 2: Insufficient Points**
1. **Setup**: Find a skin that costs more points than you have
2. **Action**: Click "Buy" button
3. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Error toast appears: "Not enough points! You need X points."
   - ✅ No crash occurs
   - ✅ Points remain unchanged

### **Test Case 3: Data Persistence**
1. **Action**: Purchase a skin successfully
2. **Action**: Close and reopen the app
3. **Action**: Navigate back to Customize Profile → Skin tab
4. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Purchased skin remains unlocked
   - ✅ Points deduction is permanent
   - ✅ Can select the purchased skin

## 📱 **Files Modified**

### **SkinSelectionFragment.java**
- **Location**: `d:\Rudy\file rudy\UNHAS\GitHub\Glean\app\src\main\java\com\example\glean\fragment\SkinSelectionFragment.java`
- **Change**: Modified `onSkinPurchase()` method to use background threading for database operations
- **Lines**: ~173-210

## 🚀 **Status**

- ✅ **Build Successful**: Project compiles without errors
- ✅ **APK Installed**: Updated app deployed to device
- ✅ **Threading Fixed**: Database operations moved to background thread
- ✅ **UI Safety**: All UI updates properly dispatched to main thread
- ✅ **Ready for Testing**: Skin purchasing should now work without crashes

## 💡 **Additional Notes**

### **Why This Issue Occurred**
Room Database enforces strict threading rules to prevent:
- UI freezing during database operations
- ANR (Application Not Responding) errors
- Poor user experience

### **Best Practices Applied**
1. **Database operations**: Always use background threads
2. **UI updates**: Always use main thread
3. **Thread safety**: Proper synchronization between threads
4. **Error handling**: Graceful handling of insufficient points

### **Alternative Solutions Considered**
- **AsyncTask**: Deprecated since API 30
- **ExecutorService**: More complex setup
- **Coroutines**: Would require Kotlin conversion
- **Simple Thread**: ✅ Chosen for simplicity and effectiveness

The simple `Thread` approach was chosen as it's straightforward, effective, and doesn't require additional dependencies or major code restructuring.
