## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **1. Basic Multi-Badge Selection**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Open the app** and navigate to Profile
2. **Tap "Customize Profile"** button
3. **Go to "Badges" tab**
4. **Current Badge Display**: Should show "Selected Badges (X/3)" when multiple badges selected
5. **Try selecting badges**:
   - Select 1st badge → Should work
   - Select 2nd badge → Should work
   - Select 3rd badge → Should work
   - Try to select 4th badge → Should show "Maximum 3 badges can be selected" toast

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Can select up to 3 badges
- ✅ Toast notification when trying to select more than 3
- ✅ Current badge display shows count when multiple selected
- ✅ Selection indicators (green checkmarks) appear on selected badges

### **2. Badge Deselection**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Select 3 badges** in Customize Profile
2. **Tap any selected badge** to deselect it
3. **Try to deselect when only 1 badge remains** selected

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Can deselect badges when 2+ are selected
- ✅ Shows "At least one badge must be selected" toast when trying to deselect last badge
- ✅ Selection indicators update correctly

### **3. Profile Badge Display**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Select 3 badges** in Customize Profile
2. **Save changes** and return to Profile
3. **Check badge display** in Profile section
4. **Try with fewer badges**: Select only 1-2 badges and check profile

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Profile shows only selected badges (max 3)
- ✅ No "View All Badges" button visible
- ✅ Consistent design with Customize Profile
- ✅ Badge cards show names, icons, and rarity levels

### **4. Storage Migration Testing**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Clear app data** or use fresh install
2. **Earn some badges** by getting points
3. **Check old preference migration**:
   - If you have an existing single badge saved, it should migrate to multi-badge system
   - First launch should work seamlessly

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Legacy single badge migrates to multi-badge list
- ✅ At least "Starter" badge is always selected
- ✅ No crashes during migration

### **5. Real-time Profile Updates**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Go to Profile** and note current badges
2. **Enter Customize Profile**
3. **Change badge selection**
4. **Return to Profile** (back button or save)
5. **Check if badge display updated**

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Profile badge display updates immediately
- ✅ Toast shows "Profile updated!" message
- ✅ Changes persist after app restart

### **6. Edge Cases Testing**

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **No earned badges**: Should show only "Starter" badge
2. **Only 1 earned badge**: Should show only that badge
3. **Only 2 earned badges**: Should show both badges
4. **Many earned badges**: Should show only selected 3

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Handles all badge count scenarios gracefully
- ✅ No crashes or empty states
- ✅ Appropriate badge filtering

### **7. Navigation Testing**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Tap any badge in Profile** → Should navigate to Customize Profile
2. **Use back button** from Customize Profile → Should return to Profile
3. **Use "Customize Profile" button** → Should open Customize Profile

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Badge clicks navigate to Customize Profile
- ✅ Navigation works in both directions
- ✅ State is preserved correctly

### **8. UI Consistency Testing**

#### Test Steps:
1. **Compare badge cards** between Profile and Customize Profile
2. **Check badge layouts** (3-column grid)
3. **Verify badge information** (name, rarity, icons)

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Identical badge card design
- ✅ Same 3-column grid layout
- ✅ Consistent badge information display
- ✅ Proper spacing and alignment

## 🔧 Technical Validation

### **Code Flow Verification:**
1. **BadgeSelectionFragment** handles multi-selection with validation
2. **ProfileBadgeAdapter** filters and displays only selected badges
3. **SharedPreferences** stores comma-separated badge list
4. **Migration logic** handles legacy single badge conversion

### **Storage Verification:**
- **Key**: `"selected_badges"` (comma-separated string)
- **Legacy Key**: `"active_badge"` (maintained for compatibility)
- **Default**: Always includes "starter" badge

### **Adapter Communication:**
- **BadgeSelectionAdapter** updates selection state
- **ProfileBadgeAdapter** filters badges and limits to 3
- **Real-time updates** via adapter notifications

## 🐛 Common Issues to Watch For

### **Potential Problems:**
1. **Selection not persisting** → Check SharedPreferences save/load
2. **Profile not updating** → Verify adapter refresh in onActivityResult
3. **Crashes on badge click** → Check null safety in adapters
4. **Wrong badge count** → Verify filtering logic in ProfileBadgeAdapter

### **Debug Tips:**
- Check LogCat for badge selection logs
- Verify SharedPreferences content using device inspector
- Test with different user point levels for badge availability

## 🎉 Success Criteria

### **System is working correctly if:**
- ✅ Users can select 1-3 badges in Customize Profile
- ✅ Profile shows only selected badges (max 3)
- ✅ Badge selection persists across app sessions
- ✅ Real-time profile updates work correctly
- ✅ Consistent design between Profile and Customize screens
- ✅ Proper validation and user feedback
- ✅ No crashes or error states
- ✅ Legacy badge migration works seamlessly
