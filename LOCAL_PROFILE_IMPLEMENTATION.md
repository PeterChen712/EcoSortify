# Local Profile Picture Implementation

## Overview
Implemented local profile picture storage solution for EcoSortify app since Firebase Storage is not available in Spark Plan.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created LocalProfileImageUtil.java
Utility class for handling local profile image storage with the following features:
- Save profile images to device's internal storage
- Automatic image resizing and compression
- Check if local profile image exists
- Delete local profile images (for logout/cleanup)
- Get default placeholder URL for Firestore
- Periodic cleanup of old images

### 2. Created ProfileImageLoader.java
Utility class for loading profile images throughout the app:
- Handles logic for own profile vs other users
- Shows local images for current user's own profile
- Shows placeholder for other users' profiles
- Provides fallback for migration from Firebase URLs

### 3. Updated ProfileFragment.java
Modified profile image handling:
- Save images locally instead of uploading to Firebase Storage
- Use placeholder URL in Firestore instead of actual image URLs
- Display local images for own profile
- Display placeholder for other users
- Clean up local images on logout
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. Added ic_profile_placeholder.xml
Created a simple profile placeholder drawable for consistent UI.

## How It Works

### For Current User's Profile:
1. When user selects/captures image â†’ Save to local storage
2. Update local database with local file path
3. Update Firestore with placeholder URL (not local path)
4. Display local image in profile

### For Other Users' Profiles:
1. Always display placeholder image
2. Ignore any profileImagePath from database
3. Consistent experience across the app

### Storage Location:
- Images stored in: `app_data/files/profile_images/profile_<userId>.jpg`
- Only accessible by the app (internal storage)
- Automatic cleanup of old images

### Firestore Integration:
- photoURL field contains placeholder/default image URL
- Maintains compatibility with existing Firestore structure
- No changes needed to Firestore security rules

## Usage Throughout App

### In Fragments/Activities:
```java
// Load profile image for any user
ProfileImageLoader.loadProfileImage(context, imageView, user);

// Load for other users (always placeholder)
ProfileImageLoader.loadOtherUserProfileImage(context, imageView);
```

### For Rankings/Lists:
```java
// Always shows placeholder for other users
ProfileImageLoader.loadOtherUserProfileImage(context, holder.profileImage);
```

## Benefits

1. **No Firebase Storage Cost**: Images stored locally
2. **Privacy**: Other users can't see your actual profile picture
3. **Performance**: No network calls for loading profile images
4. **Offline Support**: Images available without internet
5. **Auto Cleanup**: Prevents storage accumulation over time
6. **Consistent UI**: Placeholder images provide uniform experience

## Migration Notes

- Existing users: Will see placeholder until they upload new image
- No data loss: Firestore structure unchanged
- Backward compatible: Old Firebase URLs still work as fallback
- Gradual migration: Users update profile pictures naturally

## File Locations

- `util/LocalProfileImageUtil.java` - Core image handling
- `util/ProfileImageLoader.java` - Image loading utility
- `fragment/ProfileFragment.java` - Updated profile management
- `drawable/ic_profile_placeholder.xml` - Placeholder image

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload profile picture from gallery
- [ ] Take profile picture with camera
- [ ] View own profile (shows local image)
- [ ] View other user profiles (shows placeholder)
- [ ] Logout (cleans up local image)
- [ ] Network offline (profile still loads)
- [ ] App data clear (handles missing images gracefully)
