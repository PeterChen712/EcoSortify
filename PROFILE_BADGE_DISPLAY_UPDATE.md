# Profile Badge Display Update - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Objective Completed
Successfully updated the Profile page Achievements section to match the visual design and user experience of the Customize Profile badges, creating a consistent and attractive display.

## ‚úÖ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Visual Design Consistency**
- **Before**: Simple 80dp cards with basic icons in 4-column grid
- **After**: Rich 3-column grid using `item_badge_selection.xml` layout with proper spacing, shadows, and modern card design
- **Styling**: Consistent fonts, padding, margins, and colors matching Customize Profile

### 2. **Active Badge Highlighting**
- **Active Badge Indicator**: Green checkmark overlay (same as Customize Profile)
- **Visual Emphasis**: Slight scale increase (1.05x) for active badge
- **Status Display**: Shows rarity text (Common/Rare/Epic) based on badge level

### 3. **Modern Card Design**
- **Card Layout**: 12dp corner radius with 3dp elevation
- **Icon Background**: Circular light background with proper padding
- **Typography**: Bold badge names with secondary text for rarity
- **Spacing**: Professional 6dp margins and 12dp internal padding

### 4. **User Experience Enhancements**

- **Limited Display**: Shows maximum 6 badges with "View All" option
- **Smart Navigation**: All badge interactions lead to full customization interface

### 5. **Consistent Badge Logic**
- **Same Generation**: Uses identical badge logic as `BadgeSelectionFragment`
- **Achievement-Based**: Starter (0), Green Helper (50), Eco Warrior (100), Green Champion (200), Earth Guardian (500), Expert Plogger (1000), Eco Legend (2000), Master Cleaner (1500 special)
- **Icon Consistency**: Same icon mapping as Customize Profile
